# code-challenge-nasa-rover

This is just a simple java exercise:

* mars rovers need to be navigated by textfiles.
* The world is represented as grid with x,y coords.
* Terms to use are N = north, E = north, S = south, W = west, L = turn left, R = turn right, M = move one field in grid.

The requirements are:
* The application must run
* There must be a way to supply the application with the input data via text file
* evidence that the solution is complete by, as a minimum, indicating that it works correctly against the supplied test data
* Implement the application in a production ready manner
* Use no other framework as a native language. You might use 1 framework for testing.

You can build the solution by:

    gradlew assemble

unit tests (see src/test/java) can be run and reports generated by:

    gradlew test jacocoTestReport

report:
   
* html test report can be found under build\reports\tests\test\index.html
* code coverage report at build\reports\jacoco\test\html\index.html
